This script assumes that MarVid data has passed through the rStation and sample filters already, and will now undergo species filters that are common between NiN/biotope analyses. Some additional filters may only be applied on an analaysis-specific basis - these are found within the analyses projecs themselves (e.g. deepseaNiN or twinspanBiotopes).
