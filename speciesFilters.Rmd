title: "species filters for NiN/biotope classification analyses - R Notebook"
output: html_notebook
authors: Rebecca Ross and Genoveva Gonzales-Mirelis

This script assumes that MarVid data has passed through the rStation and sample filters already, and will now undergo species filters that are common between NiN/biotope analyses. Some additional filters may only be applied on an analysis-specific basis - these are found within the analyses projects themselves (e.g. deepseaNiN or twinspanBiotopes).


# Inputs
Assumes have run config and stationFilters scripts already.
Needs Taxonary

Currently using a temporary wide species_densities based object as input, when ready will replace with object generated in previous step (stationFilters)


```{r}
#temporary code to make working object




```
